# Hello World
#
# A minimal script that tests The Grinder logging facility.
#
# This script shows the recommended style for scripts, with a
# TestRunner class. The script is executed just once by each worker
# process and defines the TestRunner class. The Grinder creates an
# instance of TestRunner for each worker thread, and repeatedly calls
# the instance for each run of that thread.

# A TestRunner instance is created for each thread. It can be used to
# store thread-specific data.

    # This method is called for every run.
